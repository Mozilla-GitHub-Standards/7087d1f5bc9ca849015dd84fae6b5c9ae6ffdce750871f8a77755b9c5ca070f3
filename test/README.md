Get the coffee-script compatible version of
[expresso](https://github.com/visionmedia/expresso) to run these tests:

* [expresso for coffeescript](https://github.com/jedp/expresso)

    # run the tests (maybe add -s for serial execution)
    expresso -l coffeescript test/
    # compile to JS to inspect if necessary
    coffee -o test_js -c test


* Todo: Look into [vows](http://vowsjs.org)
