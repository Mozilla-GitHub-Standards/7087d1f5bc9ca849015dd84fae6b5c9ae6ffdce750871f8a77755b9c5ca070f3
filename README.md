How can I use it?
-----------------
You can't yet (this is just a dummy server so far). But hey, let's share the source from day 1!


Coding Style
------------

There is a [Mozilla Style Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Mozilla_Coding_Style_Guide) on MDN. This should be followed in general.

Also, the [npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm) package has pretty insightful [guidelines](https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/coding-style.md).  These are more detailed, but also unconventional. They do not clash with what  is on MDN too much, plus they exist. 

We probably want to use coffeescript and a Cakefile instead, like riak-js does  (for now we're trying that out with the unit tests).
